# Transformer Dashbord

This project develops a dashboard to simulate the impact of Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) ownership and charging behaviours over time on the transformer substations of Ontario cities.

---

## Features 
* Interactive dashboard to simulate ZEV charging behaviours.
* Accompanying chart of transformer substations loads over time from ZEV charging.
* The chart is clickable, displaying an interactive map of the corresponding transformer substations and their loads.
* Incorporates a forecast, by transformer substation service area, of ZEV ownership.
